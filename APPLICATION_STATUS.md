# CapEx Automation Application - Status Report

## Overview
The CapEx Automation Application has been completed successfully according to the system design specifications.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login Page Background Image
**Problem:** Background image was not showing on the login page because the CSS was using gradient overlays instead of the actual image file.

**Solution:** Modified `css/components.css` to use the actual background image file (`assets/images/bg.png`) with a semi-transparent overlay to maintain readability of the login form.

**Changes:**
- Updated `.login-page` background to use `url('../assets/images/bg.png')`
- Added `background-size: cover`, `background-position: center`, `background-repeat: no-repeat`, and `background-attachment: fixed` properties
- Maintained the overlay effect with a gradient to ensure text readability
